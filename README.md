# OpenRAGTech

OpenRAGTech is an open-source initiative to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system leveraging the best of open-source technologies.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid model combining the powers of retrieval-based and generative AI models. It retrieves relevant documents to a query and then generates a response based on the information contained in those documents.

## Features

- **Open-Source**: Fully open-source stack ensuring transparency and community-driven development.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to integrate and extend with other open-source projects.
- **Scalable**: Designed to scale from small to large deployments with ease.
- **Community Support**: Leverage the knowledge and support of the open-source community.
